    # - koios/dnnweaver # FIXED: Needs more slices, 160K+ LUTs, SOLUTION: needs to be run on xc7k410tfbg900-1 to have enough I/O and slices)
    # - koios/tdarknet_like.small # Needs 1600+ BRAMs SOLUTION: needs to be run on a virtex part, only ones with enough BRAM, or the design needs to change
    # - koios/gemm_layer # FIXED: 200k LUTS, SOLUTION: needs to be run on a kintex board

    # - koios/conv_layer_hls # Critical Warnings in synthesis
    # - koios/clstm_like.medium # FIXED: too many I/Os SOLUTION: needs to be run on a kintex board
    # - koios/bwave_like.float.large # FIXED: too many I/Os, need to condense output, SOLUTION: kept the vector output internal and XOR'd it into a single bit for the output
    - koios/tdarknet_like.large # Vivado synth fails -> comb assignment to registers
