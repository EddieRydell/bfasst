@W: MT529 :"/home/elicahill/icemachine/examples/ipassurance_designs/aes128_base.srcs/sources_1/imports/opencores/aes128/src/table.v":64:4:64:9|Found inferred clock top|clk_o which controls 12160 sequential elements including aes128_0.a1.S4_0.S_0.out[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
