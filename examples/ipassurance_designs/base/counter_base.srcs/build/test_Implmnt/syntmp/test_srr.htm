Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.151 is 5.004(61.4%) logic and 3.147(38.6%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.020 is 4.873(60.8%) logic and 3.147(39.2%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.011 is 4.878(60.9%) logic and 3.133(39.1%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.011 is 4.878(60.9%) logic and 3.133(39.1%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

===============================================================================================
Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 7.880 is 4.747(60.2%) logic and 3.133(39.8%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
